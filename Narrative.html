<h1> Introduction </h1>
     
        <p>
I learned many things during this project, such as how to use a menu bar, a new photo slideshow, and how to align divs. My website is a compilation of my photography and tips I have for living a healthy and stress-free life.  </p> 
 <p>I wanted to model my page after boutique websites, like wedding or clothing stores. I decided to put the menu bar at the top of the page horizontally, just because that is how most of the boutique websites tend to do it. I also wanted to put borders around my content to give the page more structure. I used divs to accomplish this and used a darker purple border to make the sections more clear. </p>
 
        <p>This page was mainly made for people in the same age bracket, as I am, so ages 18 to 25. Chiefly, I wanted to discuss the ways people can save money and eat healthy foods at a good price. I was going to go into talking about Genetically Modified Foods, but I felt that the subject is a bit heavy and lengthy for the site. I wanted this website to feel upbeat and lighthearted. I wanted the colors to pop and be vibrant, and remind people of spring. I want people to feel happy and refreshed when they see my site. I utilized a pink, yellow/beige, purple, white, and an orange palette of colors to accomplish this. </p>
        
<h1> Challenges </h1>
<p>I had some troubles getting the divs lined up just right, often I would have to play around with the pixels or percentages in order to have them look in alignment with each other on each page. I also had issues with the menu bar and getting it to horizontally span across the right “em” on the webpages. For example, if I set the “em” to 12 it would be too small, and after trying different “em”s I finally decided on 15.5em. </p>
<p>Some other issues I faced consisted of figuring out what color palette to use, which just resulted in trial-and-error. At first, I had greens in my palette, but I felt that it gave the website too much of an earthy look, and I was looking for something more light and lively. </p>
	<p>I had trouble getting bullet points inside of my divs, so I decided not to put them in. Additionally, I do not think my content would have benefitted from this. Since I decided against using recipes on my website, I did not really have lists or steps of anything.</p>
        
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I had a few different menu options, 6 to be exact, before starting this project. However, I decided against this to downsize. I think it would have been overwhelming for a visitor on the site and it was easier for me to combine similar content and pictures onto one page. Also, it is not about how much content you have, but what the content is; another words-less is more! I utilized pictures throughout most of my pages (in addition to my photography page). Since I had plenty of talking to do in the site, I wanted to balance this out with lots of pictures so visitors would not feel overwhelmed. </p>
<p>I used the break (br) tag often to give myself room between content and pictures. I learned that if they are too close together they looked jumbled. I choose to use an outside source creator to put my photos in to create a slideshow. This is so people can see the photos in a more fun way. Also, they are able to zoom in to see the photo better or more clearly. I found that it was much easier to put the images on my home page in an “img” tag on the CSS page and apply a width and height to all of them, instead of doing so one by one. </p>
<p>I also realized that putting a background color behind the divs, on top of the background color, makes the page look more professional and less mediocre. A few websites utilize this, of which I used somewhat as a guide: </p>

        <a href="http://www.sitedesignboutique.com/portfolio-items/dream-green-premade-template/">Boutique Site Example 1</a>
<br>
        <a href="http://modmelon.com/item_323/Preppy-Sweet-Three-Boutique-Website-Template.htm/">Boutique Site Example 2</a>
        <br>
        <a href="http://modernsugar.com/turnkey-boutique-websites-at-modern-sugar/">Boutique Site Example 3</a>
        
<p>I found that these websites utilize cursive or fun fonts, so I tried to use a fun cursive font in the heads of my pages. I tried to apply this font to the menu bar and other parts of the website, but upon doing so, I realized that it was difficult to read, especially if applied to smaller fonts. Then, I decided to just apply this cursive font (Pacifico) to h1s and h2s. Originally, I had the h1s aligned to the left, but after my friends had looked at it, they suggested I pull them over to the center. </p>
<p>This project taught me how to design an interactive website that effectively uses colors, structure, and readability. </p>
