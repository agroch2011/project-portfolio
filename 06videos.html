<div><p>How Designers Destroyed the World</p> 
<p>Mike Monteiro</p>

<p>After watching How Designers Destroyed the World by Mike Monteiro, I learned that designers have a lot of responsibilities, not just to themselves but to the world. I was unaware how critical one decision that was made by a Facebook designer could really alters someone's life, as it did with Bobbi Duncan. While I do agree with Montiero that is was wrong for Bobbi to have her sexual orientation exploited, I also think some of the responsibility falls on the users of the technology and apps as well. In this particular scenario, Bobbi should have been more aware that anything you say or do on the Internet is almost never private. That being said, she was careful to keep her settings private and that should have taken precedence over the chorus group page's settings. 
In addition, I find it interesting that Monteiro encourages designers to be willing to get fired. Often we think it is a bad thing if we get fired, but Monteiro argues that we are not really doing a good job of making responsible designs if we do not say "no" to clients with unethical ideas. 
I also really like his point that we are using technology or designs to not really further mankind. Monteiro used the example of using technology to go to the moon versus using technology to make our lives so easy that we do not even need to get out of bed in the morning.</p>

<p>I learned that designers have a responsibility to themselves and the world. I learned that designers should be willing to get fired to promote good designs with positive effects. And I learned that technology can either make someone's life better or worse, depending on the designer. </p>

<div><p>April 2013 Creative Mornings Pittsburgh Talk</p>

  <p>I agree with Brad’s thoughts that 90% of the content online is noise and 10% is the actual source of content we really want. He mentions that slowly we are phasing out bad companies and corporations to replace them with original and passionate sources. I like his example of Simple banking because it is truly a service that gets to the point and works to serve you, not you serving them. It is true that people are giving up their time to be on a site, so make it good and relevant. Lastly, I agree with Frost's assertion that people will circumvent bullshit or ads, even if it is illegal. It is true that everywhere you go online there is always an ad or a pop-up. Not to mention, a few years ago Youtube used to have no ads and of course, big corporations like Vevo now own such a large part of it (especially music videos) and there are ads on almost every video. </p>
        
<p>I had no idea that a third of the Internet bandwidth is used by Netflix. I also learned, around 144 billion emails are sent every day. 10% of all books published in the history of the world were published just last year. </p>

<p>Designing with Details</p>
    <p>Dan Saffer</p>
    <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2784294/video/89543518">Video Link #3</a></p></div>
    
   
  <p>Having used an android phone in the past, I really do understand the pebble-in-your-shoe effect that Saffer talks about; although the phone has functionality (like making calls and sending messages), there will be little things about it that I do not like or things that do not work well. For example, my email would shut off randomly or a picture would not open. This creates discomfort and makes the person not want to use the phone anymore. The little things are called microinteractions and can increase or destroy customer loyalty depending on how well they are made. 
I really liked Saffer’s description of loops and modes, which are good to remind a user of a specific function. The loops also adjust to be friendlier based on the user experience advancement of the person. Specifically, I liked the example he used of when a user becomes more advanced on a website, the more a button fades away to make access quicker or easier.</p>
    <p>I learned that microinteractions are the subsets of a function in technology. I learned that loops and modes are ways to remind a user of a function. And I learned that the pebble-in-your-shoe effect is a result of not liking technology because of a microinteraction problem.</p>
